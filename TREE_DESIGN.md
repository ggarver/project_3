## Tree Selection - Which tree did you choose and why?
I chose the Quadtree because I am interested in the applications of it being used in Image compression and other computer vision based projects. 

## Use Cases - What problems does this tree solve well?
Quadtrees are great for representing spatial information in images...

    Use Cases: What problems does this tree solve well?
    Properties: What makes this tree unique? What are its performance characteristics?
    Interface Design: Method signatures with descriptions
        What operations does your tree support?
        What are the parameters and return types?
        What is the Big-O time complexity of each operation? (Required for every method)
        What is the space complexity? (if relevant)
    Implementation Notes: Key algorithms or techniques you'll use

Complexity Analysis Required: Every method in your interface must include its Big-O time complexity. For example: insert(value) - O(log n) or search(key) - O(h) where h is height. If space complexity is non-trivial (not O(1)), document that as well.
⚠️ Important: Your initial interface is a starting point. You will likely need to add methods or modify signatures as you build your application. Document these changes in your final submission!
